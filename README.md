# Playwright automation test generation with prompts and vibe ðŸ˜„
This repository shows how playwright automated tests can be generated on the fly by utilizing prompts with no coding at all.

## Run Tests Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DhruvQEArchitect/PlaywrightMCPVibePrompting.git
```

## Start the execution
Note: Copilot would be able to automatically execute the tests based upon your prompt, so below command might not be needed to trigger playwright tests

```bash
  npx playwright test tests/
```

# Few things which you need before starting:
* VS Code installed
* GitHub Copilot Extension
* Playwright installed
* Playwright MCP Server
* Playwright test for vs code (Optional)
* Authorize or link your github profile with github copilot
